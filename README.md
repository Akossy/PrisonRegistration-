# PrisonRegistration-
DFESW13 Final Project
--
**Why are we doing this?**

This project serves as the culmination of all of the topics I have covered as part of my training.

**How I expected the challenge to go?**
--

I expected the project to be challenging but insteresting.
Orginally I aimed to push my code to GitHub after every method made, but I found this was taking an extensive amount of time. As a result I uploaded my project in stages. Stages 1 - 7 demonstates how my database develops in complexity, from the stating stages of creating simple methods, to the genetation of a repo and service class, to code with the only purpose of testing methods and packages within the project. I wanted to have documentation to display my understanding and development within Java. 

**What went well?**
--

Creating the concept for my project. I choose to create a register datatbase to track Prisoners within a solitary confinement unit.

**What didn't go as planned?**
--

Bebugging errors 

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?**
--

I would benefit from being able to decipher error messages. Once I can read and register what error is being shown, I could make an informed decision on how to tackle and overcome the obstacle.
